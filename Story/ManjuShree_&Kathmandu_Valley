Title: "The Story of Manjushree and Kathmandu Valley"

Long ago, in the heart of the majestic Himalayas, there existed a vast and lush valley surrounded by towering mountains. 
This valley was known as Kathmandu, and it was a place of immense beauty and natural abundance. However, it was not always as it appeared.
According to Nepali folklore, in the distant past, the Kathmandu Valley was nothing but a massive, primordial lake. A serene and tranquil lake, where animals thrived and lived in harmony with nature.
But the valley was hidden beneath the water, lost to the world.

Manjushree, a revered Bodhisattva of wisdom, looked upon this hidden paradise and felt a deep connection to it. 
He decided that the world should know of this hidden treasure and the potential it held. So, he made a decision that would change the landscape forever.
With his sword, Manjushree struck the Chobar Gorge, creating a deep cut in the earth. The gorge split the valley from the lake, allowing the water to flow out.
This gushing torrent of water became the Bagmati River, which continues to flow through the valley to this day.

As the waters receded, the Kathmandu Valley was revealed in all its glory, with its fertile soil, lush forests, and breathtaking landscapes.
It soon became a thriving hub of culture, trade, and spirituality, a place where various communities came together to build the city of Kathmandu and its surrounding towns.
This mythological story not only explains the origin of Kathmandu Valley but also highlights the idea of human intervention in nature, as well as the significance of wisdom and knowledge in shaping the world.

To this day, Manjushree's legacy lives on in the valley, and the story of how the Kathmandu Valley was formed is passed down through generations, celebrating the wisdom and connection between nature and humanity.
